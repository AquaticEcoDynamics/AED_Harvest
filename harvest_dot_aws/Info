Need to setup another harvester : harvest_dot_aws
 
This one is to connect to an Amazon S3 drive.

folder with data: /cibu.ocean/TideUTAmazon/
 
Two main sub-folders we need to harvest (FBV & BAR).
 
They each have 3 past months of data (complete months), and one “month-in-progress”. Can you make it harvest, such that the month in progress gets stamped with the day-hour?
